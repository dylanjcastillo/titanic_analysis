# Titanic dataset analysis

This repository contains a exploratory data analysis of the Kaggle's Titanic Dataset. It tries to offer some insights on how the casualties distributed among the passengers and answer some interesting (I think! haha) questions about them.

Take a look at the jupyter notebook here: [A exploratory data analysis of the Titanic's casualties](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dylanjcastillo/titanic_analysis/blob/master/Titanic%20Analysis.ipynb)
