# Titanic dataset analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis of the Kaggle's Titanic Dataset. It tries to offer some insights to solve the following question: *Were women and children more likely to survive than males?*. This project was completed as an assignment for the Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.


**Take a look at the jupyter notebook here:** [Women and children first? An exploratory data analysis of the Titanic's casualties](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dylanjcastillo/titanic_analysis/blob/master/Titanic%20Analysis.ipynb)
