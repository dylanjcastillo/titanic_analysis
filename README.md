# Titanic dataset analysis (Work In Progress)

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis of the Kaggle's Titanic Dataset. It tries to offer some insights on how the casualties were distributed among the passengers and answer some interesting (I think! haha) questions about them. This project was completed as an assignment for the Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

**Take a look at the jupyter notebook here:** [A exploratory data analysis of the Titanic's casualties](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dylanjcastillo/titanic_analysis/blob/master/Titanic%20Analysis.ipynb)
